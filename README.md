# CodingProgress

This is where I'll put every single little thing I code until I can do coding for a living.
I'll try to do a little coding everyday after work. 
Maybe this github ends up helping someone who wants to get started but it's feeling unmotivated like I am today.
It's been difficult finding the time to practice code while looking for a job. But doing something trivially simple is better than doing nothing.
